Welcome to my computer science journey!
=======================================

My name is Karim Itani. I graduated with a **BA of finance and economics** but realized quickly after that software engineering is my
true passion. I work as a **Site Reliability Engineer** at a bank during the day and study for my **BsC of computer science**
(University of London) during the evening.

Teaching is the best way to learn, a.k.a the `Feynman Technique <https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/>`. You're forced to understand a subject deeply and be able to explained it
clearly and simply to others.

This documentation website is a collection of my study notes, my musings and personal projects. I hope you find them useful,
interesting and informative.
