Welcome to my computer science journey!
=======================================
I'm **Karim Itani**, I have a **BA of Finance and Economics** but software is my true passion. I work as a **Site Reliability Engineer** at a bank
during the day but during the evening I study for my **BsC of Computer Science**  at University of London.

Teaching is the best way to learn, a.k.a the `Feynman Technique <https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/>`. You're forced to
understand a subject deeply and be able to explained it clearly and simply to others.

This documentation website is a collection of my study notes, my musings and personal projects. I hope you find them useful,
interesting and informative.

.. Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
.. how to :ref:`installation` the project.
